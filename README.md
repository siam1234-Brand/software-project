Why XP is the Best Fit for This Project

We chose XP for the Delivery Management System for several reasons:

Pair programming:

In the Pair programming it allows two people to program at a time, one person is brainstorming, another is involved with writing code. By this we can used to write code efficiently for a long time.

Frequent Requirement Changes:

Our system consists of different user roles- admin, employee, carrier, client, and their needs will likely change as we develop. XP works well here because it’s built to adapt quickly to changing requirements through its short development cycles.

Metaphor: In metaphor there is a shared story which is a summary of the overall project describes how the system will work for development. By this our project team will get a clear understanding of what the project needs. 

40-hour week: Developer can maximum 40-hour work in a week. So that the developers’ working productivity will increase.

Reduced Risk:

XP reduces the risk of major issues later in the process because we get constant feedback and release small, incremental updates regularly. If something isn’t working, we can address it immediately rather than discovering it late in the project.

On-site customer: 

We can understand the requirements perfectly and the problems because a customer must present full time And available for our team.



XP will work perfectly in our Delivery Management System Because XP values like communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, respect which will enhance our project progress. Besides it’s Practices will  also help us to develop the project smoothly.
